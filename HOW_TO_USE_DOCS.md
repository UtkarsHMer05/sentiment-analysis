## 💡 Best Practices

### 1. Link Between Documents

Each document should reference others when relevant:
- QUICK_START.md → links to SETUP_GUIDE.md for details
- SETUP_GUIDE.md → links to TROUBLESHOOTING.md for issues
- README.md → links to all specific guides

### 2. Keep README.md Concise

Your main README.md should:
- ✅ Provide overview and features
- ✅ Show quick start (brief)
- ✅ Link to detailed guides
- ❌ Don't duplicate full setup instructions

### 3. Update as You Go

When you make changes:
- Update the relevant guide (SETUP_GUIDE.md, etc.)
- Add new issues to TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- Keep commands in QUICK_REFERENCE.md current
