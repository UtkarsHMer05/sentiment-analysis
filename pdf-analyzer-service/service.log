Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.

Failed to determine 'entailment' label id from the label2id mapping in the model config. Setting to -1. Define a descriptive label2id mapping in the model config to ensure correct outputs.
